/**
 * AWS CDK Application Entry Point for NJ AI Assistant Service
 *
 * This file serves as the main entry point for the AWS CDK application, responsible for
 * bootstrapping the infrastructure deployment process. It creates the CDK app instance and
 * instantiates the NJ AI Assistant stack with appropriate configuration for different environments.
 *
 * The application supports environment-specific deployments and follows AWS CDK best practices for
 * infrastructure as code. Environment configuration is determined through CDK context variables and
 * AWS CLI configuration.
 *
 * @version 1.2.0
 * @file CDK application bootstrap and stack instantiation
 * @example
 *   ```bash
 *   # Deploy to default environment
 *   cdk deploy˙
 *
 *   # Deploy to specific account and region
 *   cdk deploy --context account=123456789012 --context region=us-east-1
 *
 *   # Synthesize CloudFormation template
 *   cdk synth
 *   ```;
 *
 * @see {@link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/} AWS CDK Developer Guide
